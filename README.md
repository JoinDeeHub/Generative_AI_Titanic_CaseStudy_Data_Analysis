🚢 Titanic Data Analysis with Generative AI

This repository contains a hands-on project that applies Generative AI prompt engineering to perform end-to-end data analysis on the Titanic dataset.


📂 What’s Inside

Titanic_Data_Analysis_Workbook.ipynb – Google Colab notebook with Python code for data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

Titanic_Prompt_Guidebook.pdf – A structured PDF guide of strong prompts crafted for each analysis task.

Titanic_Analysis_Report.pdf – A report with prompts, outputs, and visualizations.

titanic.csv – The dataset used for the analysis.


🧑‍💻 Project Tasks

Load Data – Import and preview dataset

Basic Statistics – Mean, Median, Mode, Std Dev, Min, Max

Data Quality – Missing values & Outlier detection

Univariate Analysis – Histogram of Age distribution

Bi-variate Analysis – Survival rate by Sex


🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

Practice in prompt engineering for structured analysis tasks

Automated Python code generation from well-designed prompts

Combining data analysis & visualization with AI-driven workflows

Delivering outputs as PDF reports & Colab 


🚀 How to Use

Clone the repo

Open Titanic_Data_Analysis_Workbook.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter

Run the notebook step by step

Refer to Titanic_Prompt_Guidebook.pdf for reusable prompts

✨ With this project, you learn not only data analysis but also how to use Generative AI effectively as a coding assistant.
